the last three do not explicitly indicate the variable and should not be
used unless there is no chance of a misunderstanding.

4: Similarly, if y = f (as) and if as, as the inverse function
of y, be written a:=f-1(y) from analogy with y zsina: and a:=sin-13/, the
relation (5) follows from the fact that A2:/Ay and Ay/A3: are reciprocals.
-------
5: The rule for differentiating a power is derived
in case n is integral by the application of the binomial theorem.

6: The result may be extended to rational

values of the index n by Writing n = -15, y = 9:3, 3/1 = 9:19 and by differentiating

both sides of the equation and reducing.
-------
7: The formula is therefore assumed in accordance with the principle of
permanence of form (§ 178), just as formulas like ama" = a"'+" of the theory of
exponents, which may readily be proved for rational bases and exponents, are
assumed without proof to hold also for irrational bases and exponents.
-------
8: It is frequently better to regard the quotient as the product u - v-1 and apply (6).
-------
9: For when Ax é 0, then Ay é 0 or Ag//A9: could not approach a limit.
-------
10: To integrate a function f (arr) is to ﬁnd
a function  the derivative of which is f The integral F(x) is
not uniquely determined by the integrand f (1'); for any two functions
which diifer merely by an additive constant have the same derivative.
-------
11: It must not be thought that the constant of integration always appears added to the -
function F (93).
-------
12: It may be combined with F (2) so as to be somewhat disguised.
-------
13: To illustrate the
determination of the constant by initial conditions, consider the problem of ﬁnding
the area under the curve 3/ = cdsz.
-------
14: By (43)
D,,A-: y = cosz and hence A = sina: + C.
-------
15: Hence A = sin :43.
-------
16: But if the area be
measured from :c=—}1r, then A=O when :c=—§1r and C’ :1.

19: Integration by parts is an application of (61) when written as
fun’ = uv — fu’v.
-------
20: That is, it may happen that the integrand can be written as the product uv’ of two
factors, where v’ is integrable and where u’v is also integrable.
-------
21: Then uv’ is integrable.
-------
22: For instance, logo: is not integrated by the fundamental formulas ; but
flogxzflogmlzzloga:-—-fa:/aszazlogaz-9:.
-------
23: Here log 3; is taken as u and 1 as v’,i so that v is 2:, u’ is 1/9:, and u’v = 1 is immedi-
ately integrable.
-------
24: Here if to = u and sin :1: = 1:’, both 1:’ and u’v = — cosa: are integrable.
-------
25: If the choice
Sin z=u and x: 1:’ had been made, 22’ would have been integrable but u’v=§ 3:2 cos 3;
would have been less simple to integrate than the original integrand.
-------
26: Hence in
applying integration by parts it is necessary to look ahead far enough to see that
both 22’ and u"v are integrable, or at any rate that v’ is integrable and the integral
of u’v is simpler than the original integral!‘
Frequently integration by parts has to be applied several times in succession.

27: For example,

38: Ax be considered and the
rectangle corresponding to the ordinate f(£) be drawn, it is clear that
the area of the rectangle is f($) Ax, that the area of all the rectangles is
the sum 2f(E) Ax taken from a, to b, that when the intervals Ax approach
zero the limit of their sum is the area under the curve ; and hence that
area may be written as the deﬁnite integral of f(a:) from a to b.
-------
39: In like manner consider the mass of a rod of variable density and suppose the
rod to lie along the :c-axis so that the density may be taken as a function of 1:.
-------
40: In any small length A2: of the rod the density is nearly constant and the mass of
that part is approximately equal to the product pm: of the density p(:c) at the
initial point of that part times the length A2: ef the part.
-------
41: In fact it is clear that
the mass will be intermediate between the products mm: and MM, Where m and
M are the minimum and maximum densities in the interval Ax.
-------
42: In other Words
the mass of the section A2: will be exactly equal to p (5) A2: Where 5 is some value of
:1: in the interval A23.
-------
43: The mass of the whole rod is therefore the sum 2p(£)Aa;
taken from one end of the rod to the other, and if the intervals be allowed to
approach zero, the mass may be written as the integral of p(a:) from one end of
the rod to the other.

-------
50: The £’s may evidently be so chosen that the ﬁnite sum 2‘,f(£) Arc is exactly equal to
the area under the curve ; but still it is necessary to let the intervals approach zero and
thus replace the sum by an integral because the values of 5 which make the sum equal
to the area are unknown.
