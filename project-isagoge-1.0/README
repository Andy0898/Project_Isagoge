This software requires Leptonica http://www.leptonica.com/.
The dlib machine learning library is included here. To compile
some of the dlib examples you may need to modify the automake file in
src/dlib-18.4/examples. If you are on a 32 bit system you'll likely need 
to change occurences of lib64 to lib32 in a couple of the dlib automake
files.

Before running ./configure, first run ./autogen.sh. 

Tesseract won't be able to find the language information (stored in the
tessdata/ directory) unless you either place tessdata/ in /usr/local/share/
directory or if you put it in any other directory but make the environmental
variable TESSDATA_PREFIX point to it. The tessdata/ directory should contain
the language information that can be found at
https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/downloads/list. This work has only been tested on English currently but could also be tested on other languages potentially.

To use the scrollview for debugging you need to run make in the Tesseract 
java directory and also set the SCROLLVIEW_PATH environment variable to
point to the path of that directory. 

See INSTALL for further build instructions
