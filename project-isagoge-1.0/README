This software requires Leptonica http://www.leptonica.com/.
The dlib machine learning library is included here. To compile
some of the dlib examples you may need to modify the automake file in
src/dlib-18.4/examples.

Before running ./configure, first run ./autogen.sh. 

See INSTALL for further build instructions
