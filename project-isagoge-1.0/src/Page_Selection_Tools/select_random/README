select_random

- Randomly selects a desired number of .png images from a set generated by convert_pdfpages. 
  If the desired number is greater than the number of images in the set, then the number
  in the set is simply returned. As the number of desired random images approaches the 
  number in the set, the degree of randomness decreases
