Here is a description of all of the tools developed to generate data

convert_pdfpages 
- Script to convert a multi-page pdf document into individual png images with up to 
  600 dpi resolution (may be lower depending on the resolution within the pdf document).   

select_random
- Randomly selects a desired number of .png images from a set generated by convert_pdfpages. 
  If the desired number is greater than the number of images in the set, then the number
  in the set is simply returned. As the number of desired random images approaches the 
  number in the set, the degree of randomness decreases

remove_alpha
- Sometimes the images may have an alpha rather than white background. Given the output
  of select_random and the name of the pdf (without extension) from which the png's
  where generated, this script will replace alpha background with white background
  for desired images.

rename_pngs
- Renames all of the .png files selected by the select_random script so that they are 
  simply named by their index number (ie 000.png,001.png,etc)

select_training
- Randomly selects a desired subset of the images from select_random assuming they 
  have already been renamed by rename_pngs and placed in a separate directory.
  Places these randomly selected training images in a chosen directory

Equation_Labeler
- GUI developed in Qt, which allows user to manually label the bounding boxes of 
  expression regions in images, and have the labels automatically appended to 
  a file.Originally from OSR project at http://sourceforge.net/projects/osr/.
