This is the dlib machine learning library used for this project
Visit http://dlib.net for more info. The examples are included here
but don't compile with the project by default since they take 
FOREVER. If you want to compile the examples just change the Makefile.am
in this directory so that examples is in SUBDIR rather than EXTRA_DIST.
